This repository (Personal Portfolio) is an educational homework assignment from CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C code boot-camp. It combines our knowledge of 
html5 and CSS together to create a personal portfolio that we can use through-out the course and after we graduate to show potential employers what we have 
accomplished. 

# Assignment
This assignemnt was designed for the class to demonstrate our work to a potential hiring manager. Being that this is the begining of the course, there are only a couple 
projects added. There will be many more added through-out the course.

# Acceptance Criteria 
<copied from the homework assignment directly>
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

#Installation 
Making the website was so much fun. I decided not to use the exact make-up of the portfolio offered as it was not that asthetically pleasing.
I decided to be more creative and use a theme through-out the website. I used the same colors from the visual studio code, coding screen on the site. 
I remebered the <span> element used in the first homework assignment and decided to use it here. I used it to change the colors of my name on 
top of the screen. I decided to add a picture of just how I feel doing this course, outside my comfort zone. There is a picture of myself and all links work. 



#What I Learnt 
The hardest part of this assignment was making the page look like a webpage. The first webpages we made in the activities of the course where 
very basic and lacked proper spacing and everything started on the left side of the page. Being able to move things, relative to their position and making them
inter-mingle with each other, makes the structure more pleasing to the eye. 
I was able to add a proper readme file this time. The broblem I had last time was that I made the repository without a readme file in the initial setup and 
tried to add one after the fact. What I should have done was erase the entire repository and started all over again. This time I set it up initially and 
added to it as progressed through the assignment.
